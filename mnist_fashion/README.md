This is a sample "project" that shows how to train a simple image classifier in Azure Machine Learning. The model
training used here bases on a Tensorflow tutorial and is not state-of-the-art. However, it shows some of AML's main
concepts such as AML pipelines and deployment of models. Use this as a starting point for building more advanced models.
