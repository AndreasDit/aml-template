# **amls-template**

A light-weight and (hopefully) self-explanatory template for Azure Machine Learning Services.

This repo shall serve as a template for creating an end-to-end solution on Azure Machine Learning Services. Its purpose
is to catalyze ML projects and help them get faster to production.

It starts at setting up the environment, then does exploratory data analysis, creates a model training pipeline and
finally ends with a deployed, enterprise-ready inferencing webservice.

If you have any pull request I should integrate, let me know.

As always - feel free to use but don't blame me if things go wrong. You have been warned!
